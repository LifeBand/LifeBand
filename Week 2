Group Decisions:
	We will send messages with udp, encoding and decoding with Json
	They will be a dictionary
	We will all work on the code together, spending more time as a team each week to work
	Two days will be designated each week totalling approximately 10 hours for both

Preparing for the next meeting:
	Get familiar with Json
		Encoding
		Decoding
	Understand python dictionaries and java hashmaps
	start writing test code so we have a place to get started from
